## Quick Start

For detailed deployment, I need your GCP credentials. Here's what I need:

1. **GCP Project ID** (or create new one)
2. **Billing Account ID**
3. **Service Account Key** (JSON file)

Run this to get started:

```bash
# Login to GCP
gcloud auth login

# List projects
gcloud projects list

# Get billing accounts
gcloud billing accounts list
```

Provide me these values and I'll handle the deployment.
