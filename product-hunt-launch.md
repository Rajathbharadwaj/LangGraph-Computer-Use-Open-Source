### Maker's First Comment

```
Hey PH! 👋

I built Parallel Universe after watching a restaurant owner I know struggle
with social media. She had 200 loyal customers but zero online presence —
not because she didn't care, but because she was too busy *actually running
her business*.

Most "AI social tools" either:
- Generate generic spam that sounds robotic
- Require constant babysitting and approval
- Promise "10x growth" with zero authenticity

We took a different approach: **restraint as a feature**.

Our agents are trained to recognize when NOT to engage. A low-quality thread?
Skip it. A controversial topic? Stay silent. Silence isn't failure — it's judgment.

What you get:
✦ Autonomous engagement that matches your voice
✦ Smart content generation from your business context
✦ Analytics on what's actually working
✦ Human oversight when you want it

We're starting with X/Twitter because voice matters most there.
SMBs — restaurants, salons, local businesses — you're next.

Early users get 25% off. Would love your feedback!

## Pre-Launch Tweet Strategy (2 Weeks)

### Week 1: Philosophy & Origin Story

#### Day 1 — The Hook

```
Unpopular opinion: The best AI social media tool is one that knows when to shut up.

Most tools optimize for engagement at all costs.

What if we optimized for judgment instead?
```

#### Day 2 — The Origin Story (Thread)

**Main tweet:**
```
A restaurant owner changed how I think about AI.

She has 200+ loyal regulars. Zero social media presence.

Not because she doesn't care. Because she's too busy actually running her business.

🧵 Thread:
```

**Thread 1:**
```
1/ Every "social media expert" told her she was leaving money on the table.

"Just post consistently!"
"Engage with your community!"
"It only takes 30 minutes a day!"

She tried. For 2 weeks. Then stopped.

Because 30 minutes a day is 182 hours a year she doesn't have.
```

**Thread 2:**
```
2/ So I asked: what if an AI could do it for her?

Not just schedule posts. Actually *run* her presence.

Reply to customers. Thank people for reviews. Share what's happening in the kitchen.

But here's the thing she said that stuck with me:
```

**Thread 3:**
```
3/ "I'd rather have no social media than sound like every other restaurant with those generic AI posts."

She wasn't anti-AI. She was anti-inauthenticity.

And she's right. Most AI social tools make you sound like... an AI social tool.
```

**Thread 4:**
```
4/ That's when I realized:

The hard part isn't making AI that posts more.

It's making AI that knows when NOT to post.

When to stay silent. When to walk away from a toxic thread. When engagement isn't worth it.

Restraint as a feature, not a bug.
```

**Thread 5:**
```
5/ I've been building something based on this idea.

An AI agent that runs your X presence autonomously — but with judgment.

It knows your voice. It knows when to engage. And critically, it knows when to shut up.

More soon. 👀
```

#### Day 3 — Engagement Bait

```
Quick poll for founders:

How much time do you spend on social media per week?

A) 0-2 hours (I've given up)
B) 3-5 hours (bare minimum)
C) 5-10 hours (it's a job)
D) 10+ hours (send help)
```

#### Day 4 — Philosophy

```
Hot take: "AI-powered growth" is a red flag now.

It's code for "we'll spam on your behalf."

The next wave of AI tools won't compete on volume.

They'll compete on taste.
```

#### Day 5 — Behind the Scenes

```
Building an AI that knows when NOT to do something is surprisingly hard.

Most ML optimizes for action. Engagement. Clicks.

Teaching restraint means training on what *didn't* happen.

The silent wins. The threads we walked away from.

Harder problem. Better product.
```

### Week 2: Product Tease & Launch Build-up

#### Day 6 — First Product Tease

```
Sneak peek of what I've been building 👀

An AI agent that runs your X autonomously.

But the feature I'm most proud of isn't what it does.

It's what it refuses to do.

```

#### Day 7 — Social Proof Setup

```
Showed this to a founder friend yesterday.

Her reaction: "Wait, so I just... don't have to think about Twitter anymore?"

Me: "That's the idea."

Her: "And it won't make me sound like a LinkedIn influencer?"

Me: "That's the other idea."
```

#### Day 8 — Contrarian Take

```
Controversial opinion:

"Consistency" is overrated advice for social media.

Posting mid content consistently is worse than posting great content occasionally.

Most AI tools optimize for the former.

I'd rather build something that knows the difference.
```

#### Day 9 — The Name Drop

```
Finally ready to share what I've been working on.

It's called Parallel Universe.

An AI agent that runs your X presence — so you can focus on running your actual business.

Launching on Product Hunt next week.

Early access link in bio. First 100 get 25% off forever.
```

#### Day 10 — Differentiation

```
What Parallel Universe does:
✦ Engages with your audience authentically
✦ Generates content in your voice
✦ Grows your presence while you sleep

What it doesn't do:
✗ Spam generic replies
✗ Chase engagement at all costs
✗ Make you sound like a bot

The second list was harder to build.
```

#### Day 11 — Founder Vulnerability

```
Real talk: I'm nervous about launching this.

The AI social media space is crowded with tools that over-promise.

"10x your followers!"
"Dominate your niche!"
"Guaranteed growth!"

I'm launching with: "We'll grow your presence... or stay silent trying."

Less sexy. More honest.
```

#### Day 12 — Launch Eve

```
Launching Parallel Universe on Product Hunt tomorrow.

If you've ever:
- Wanted to grow on X but don't have time
- Tried AI tools that made you sound robotic
- Given up on social because it felt like a chore

This is for you.

Link drops at 12:01 AM PT 🚀
```

#### Day 13 — Launch Day

```
We're live on Product Hunt! 🚀

Parallel Universe: AI agents that grow your X — without losing your voice.

The first AI social tool built around restraint, not spam.

Would mean the world if you checked it out 👇

[Product Hunt link]
```

#### Day 13 — Launch Day Follow-up (afternoon)

```
Overwhelmed by the response today 🙏

Quick note on why I built this:

Most AI tools treat silence as failure.

But sometimes the smartest move is no move.

The best agents know when to engage — and when to walk away.

Thanks for the support. Back to building.
```

## Engagement Reply Templates

### When someone asks "how is this different?"

```
Most tools optimize for volume. Post more, engage more, grow more.

We optimize for judgment. The right engagement > more engagement.

Our agent will literally refuse to reply to low-quality threads.

Restraint is the feature.
```

### When someone is skeptical about AI authenticity

```
Totally valid concern. Most AI social tools DO sound robotic.

Our approach: we train on YOUR voice, not generic templates.

And more importantly — we'd rather stay silent than post something that doesn't sound like you.

The bar is authenticity, not activity.
```

### When someone asks about pricing

```
Starting at $X/month. Early PH supporters get 25% off forever.

But honestly — if it saves you 5+ hours/week on social, the ROI math is pretty simple.
```
